  </dt>
</dl> 

1. Open a new terminal. Using the `cd` command, change into your chosen directory.
2. Clone this repository using the folowing command (I am using `HTTPS` to keep it general, but using `SSH` is recommended)
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Quintin-Russell/zoomies.git
  ```
3. Using the `cd` command again, enter into the created directory (`zoomies`)
  ```shell
  cd zoomies
  ```
4. While in the `zoomies` directory, install the necessary dependencies by running the `npm install` command
  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
5. Start the `Flask` api proxy using the `npm run start-api` command in the terminal. It should start on port `5000`
  ```shell
  npm run start-api
  ```
6. Open a new terminal and use the `cd` command to enter into the zoomies `directory`. 
7. Start the application using the `npm run dev` command
  ```shell
  npm run dev
  ```
8. Open up `http://localhost:3000` in your browser of choice and enjoy!
